# Data-Mining-labs

## About The repository

This repository contains 2 different labs about data mining.Each lab introduces new concepts on the subject.

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/).
* [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).


## Prerequisites

* Make sure that **Python** is installed on your operating system. (download from ```https://www.python.org/downloads/```)
(Jupyter is more of a feature)

## Content
 
### Lab1 :  Supervised Classification

It represents an introduction to the **scikit-learn Python library**.You will be able to : 
1) Read and manipulate Datasets (Iris Dataset).
2) Create and use a classifier with different algorithms (Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees).
3) Evaluate classifier performances (Calculating errors).
4) Use cross-validation to evaluate the classifier.


### Lab2 :  Clustering

It represents an introduction to the concept of **Unservised Learning**.You will be able to : 
1) Read and manipulate Datasets.
2) Using **kmeans** for the clustering. 
3) Learning the silhouette coefficient utility.
4) Using **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (CAH)** and generating the **Dendrogram**.
5) Using **Principal component analysis (PCA)**.
6) Implementing the **Dvisive ANAlysing (DIANA)** algorithm.
